# Deep learning of geological structures from seismic reflection data

Here we share code, tutorials and examples showing how to interpret geological structures (e.g. faults, salt bodies and horizones) in 2-D and/or 3-D seismic reflection data using deep learning.

## Setup
1. Install **Python 3**
2. Install required packages listed in ```requirements.txt```. You can install these packages with:

``` pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt ```

3. Clone git repository:

```git clone https://github.com/thilowrona/seismic_deep_learning/```
