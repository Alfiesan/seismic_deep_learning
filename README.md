# Deep learning of geological structures from seismic reflection data

![alt text](https://github.com/thilowrona/seismic_deep_learning/blob/master/image.png)

Here we share code, tutorials and examples showing how to interpret geological structures (e.g. faults, salt bodies and horizones) in 2-D and/or 3-D seismic reflection data using deep learning (see poster and preprint). To get started, you don't need any special hardware, software, data or experience. Check out [tutorial-1/tutorial-1.ipyng](https://github.com/thilowrona/seismic_deep_learning/blob/master/tutorial-1/tutorial-1.ipynb).
