# Deep learning of geological structures from seismic reflection data

Here we share a series of workflows developed to interpret different geological structures in seismic reflection data using deep convolutional neural networks.

## Setup
1. Install **Python 3**
2. Install required packages listed in ```requirements.txt```. You can install these packages with:

``` pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt ```

3. Clone git repository:

```git clone https://github.com/thilowrona/seismic_deep_learning/```
