# Deep learning of geological structures from seismic reflection data

INCLUDE IMAGE HERE

Here we share code, tutorials and examples showing how to interpret geological structures (e.g. faults, salt bodies and horizones) in 2-D and/or 3-D seismic reflection data using deep learning (see poster and preprint). To get started, you won't need any special hardware, software, data or experience. One of the easiest ways of getting started is to use Colab, where most of the things we need (GPU, Cuda, Tensorflow) are already set up.
