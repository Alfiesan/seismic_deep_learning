# Deep learning of geological structures from seismic reflection data

INCLUDE IMAGE HERE

Here we share code, tutorials and examples showing how to interpret geological structures (e.g. faults, salt bodies and horizones) in 2-D and/or 3-D seismic reflection data using deep learning (see poster and preprint). To get started, you won't need any special hardware, software, data or experience. Just a bit of time.

## Getting started
One of the easiest ways of getting started is to use Colab, where most of the things we need (GPU, Cuda, Tensorflow) are already set up. The first tutorial, which is based on the excellent https://course.fast.ai/ by Jeremy Howard, shows you how to set up everything to train your first deep learning model to classify salt in seismic images. Just go to [Tutorial-1/tutorial-1.ipyng](https://github.com/thilowrona/seismic_deep_learning/blob/master/Tutorial-1/tutorial-1.ipynb).
